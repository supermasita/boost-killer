BOOST KILLER

This a is a script to clean Drupal's Boost Page Cache (http://drupal.org/project/boost) 
when using "Retro mode" (no database).

The script requires that the Boost tag is enabled (chech "Performance/Boost"
config). In the end of the static HTML you shoud see something like :

<!-- Page cached by Boost @ 2012-01-20 12:42:18, expires @ 2012-01-20 12:57:18 -->


This tag is used by the script to detect if the static HTML is current or should
be erased, based on the configuration you chose globally or per page/view/etc.
